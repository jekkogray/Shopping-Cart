## Description
This homework will have you develop a web store application.

## Deadlines
- Phase 1: Database ER diagram due 02/20 before lab time via GitHub (please also bring a printed copy to lab).
  - [X] Open an issue in your repository when the file is ready for review. Use markdown in the comment to add a link to your file in your local repository
- Phase 2: Complete application due 02/26 at 7 pm.

## Application Requirements

A user visiting your web store application can search for products (you must be able to search for a specific item name and display that item, and search and display all items in a certain category) and see all products and their available quantity.

Only a logged in user can add products to a shopping cart and "buy" various quantities of products. To "buy" a product means to reduce the quantity from that product with the quantity that was "bought" (i.e. your database should be updated to reflect the reduction in quantity of items after purchase).

A logged in user shopping cart can be viewed, edited, checked out or deleted. A logged in user can also see his/her orders history if there are any.

### PHP	Usage

#### GET:	`$_GET['variablename']`
The	variable	is	appended	to	the	http	address,	and	is	transmitted	in	the	same	stream (i.e.:	http://www.somesite.com/index.php?a=1&b='x') making it easy	to bookmark

#### POST:	`$_POST['variablename']`
A new	stream	is	created,	and	all	the	post	variables	are	transmitted	in	this	stream.	The	http	address	is	clean	(no	bookmarks).

#### SESSION
HTTP	is	stateless,	so	we	need	something	to	simulate	a	stateful	connection.	This	maintains	records	on	the	server	side	until	the	browser	is	closed. This	allows	us	to	build	a	'shopping	cart',	or	anything	similar.

USAGE:
```
session_start();
$_SESSION['foo']='bar';
$_SESSION['a']['b']='c';
```
